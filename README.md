# HarmonicOscillator
Model of a simple system's response to an input force. 
Position, velocity and acceleration graphed in real-time.

# To Use
- Have Python 3.7 installed on your computer. 
- Using pip, or the installer of your choice, make sure that numpy, keyboard and PyQt5 libraries are installed on your comptuter.
- Run HarmonicOscillator.py using Python 3.7.
- Press the '1' and '2' keys on your keyboard to excert a force on the system

# What I learned
- How to display real-time data using PyQt and matplotlib. 
- How to use Maple to solve differential equations of motion, then export those equations to Python.
